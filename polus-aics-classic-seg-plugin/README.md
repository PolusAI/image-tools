# Allen Cell Structure Segmenter

This WIPP plugin does things, some of which involve math and science. There is likely a lot of handwaving involved when describing how it works, but handwaving should be replaced with a good description. However, someone forgot to edit the README, so handwaving will have to do for now. Contact [Gauhar Bains](mailto:gauhar.bains@labshare.org) for more information.

For more information on WIPP, visit the [official WIPP page](https://isg.nist.gov/deepzoomweb/software/wipp).
